## Showcase

We will now be able to display our NFT collection on a website and allow user to use the interface to buy and sell tokens. 

### Instructions

- Reuse the `Napping Cats` smart contract from the previous exercise 
- Create a webpage index.html that connects to the napping Cats smart contract and displays the corresponding URIs as a table

- * ptionally : the buy button display the current price of this specific token
- Once the wallet is connected, offer a sell token under the tokens owned by the user 
    - The button should open a modal or include an input field to give a listing price.
