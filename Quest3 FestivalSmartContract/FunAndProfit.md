## Fun and Profit

The Festival is going well. Attendees are entereing by redeeming tickets and enjoying it. It is now is time for the organizer to cash out the benefits. 

### Instructions

- Create a new Smart Contract `FunAndProfit` that implements `buyTicket` and `ticketsOf` from the prior exercice
- Add a function `redeemTicket` that allows an attendee to give return one ticket. The function should fail (revert) if the attendee does not own any ticket
- Add a function `getBenefits` that sends all the benefits from the Festival to the organizer.
