## Lineup

For this to be a good festival, we need to register artists. 

### Instructions

- Create a new Smart Contract `Lineup`
- Create a function `addArtist(string)` that takes as parameter a string. Artists are added in their order of registration
- Create a function`lineup(uint)` that given an index returns the name of corresponding artist

*Hint: public variables offer an implicit getter function*
