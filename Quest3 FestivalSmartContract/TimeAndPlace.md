## Time and Place

To be a considered a festival, we need initially specify a time and a place. Everything else can be organised later.

### Instructions

- Create a new Smart Contract `TimeAndPlace`.

- The Smart Contract contains a special `constructor` function that takes as parameter an `uint` that is an Unix timestamp representation of the date of beginning of the festival and a parameter `string` that is the address of the festival.

- create a function `getStartTime` that returns the starting time (and date) of the festival as an Unix timestamp.

- create a function `getPlace` that returns the place of the festival.

### Resources

- [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

### Relevance

We have now a constructor function.
