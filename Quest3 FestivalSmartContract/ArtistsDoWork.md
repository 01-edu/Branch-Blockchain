## Artists Do Work !

Artists deserve to be payed too! 

### Instructions

- Create a Smart Contract `ArtistsDoWork` with a function `buyTicket` that takes no parameters and allow an user to buy a ticket paying 0.1 ether or more. 
- Add a function `addRemuneratedArtist` that takes as parameters an `address` to register an artist to the festival. Only the organizer that deployed the Smart Contract can trigger that function
- Add a function `getPayed` that takes not parameters and that allows an artist registered with the function above to receive 1 Ether **once**, providing that there are enough funds in the Smart Contract!
