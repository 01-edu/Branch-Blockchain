## Register with events

In order to facilitate the use of our Smart Contract, we will add events. Events in solidity are used to facilate the retrieval of information.

### Instructions

Write solidity smart contract `RegisterWithEvents` that provides 
- A `addDocument()` and `getDate()` as specified in the prior exercise.
- An event `event DocumentAdded(bytes32, uint)` that triggers when a new document is added to the register
