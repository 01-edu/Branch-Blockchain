## Introduction

*Listen, I'm not the nicest guy in the universe because I'm the smartest. And being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets. - Rick Sanchez*

On of the key factors of blockchain success over the past years has been the creation of standarts. Those token standarts allow interoperability and composability of smart contracts. 

Today, We will start by creating a Minimal Token that provides the basic functionnalities of a token. From this, we will build basic services using this token. This will allow us to learn more advanced functionalities of Smart Contracts. 

## Content
### Mandatory
1. [Minimal Token](minimalToken/README.md)
2. [Token Sale](tokenSale/README.md)
3. [Usable token](usableToken/README.md)
4. [Basic Swap](basicSwap/README.md)
### Optional
5. [Eventful token](eventfulToken/README.md)
6. [Transfers History](transfersHistory/README.md)


## Integration
In this Quest, tests can be run with
```sh
npm i 
npx hardhat test tests/<exercice>.test.js
```
