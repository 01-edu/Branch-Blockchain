## Introduction

On of the key factors of blockchain success over the past years has been the creation of standarts. Those token standarts allow interoperability and composability of smart contracts. 

Today, We will start by creating a Minimal Token that provides the basic functionnalities of a token. From this, we will build basic services using this token. This will allow us to learn more advanced functionalities of Smart Contracts.
