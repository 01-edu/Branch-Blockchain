# Simple Tokens

_Listen, I'm not the nicest guy in the universe because I'm the smartest. And being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets. - Rick Sanchez_

On of the key factors of blockchain success over the past years has been the creation of standards. Those token standards allow interoperability and composability of smart contracts.

Today, We will start by creating a Minimal Token that provides the basic functionalities of a token. From this, we will build basic services using this token. This will allow us to learn more advanced functionalities of Smart Contracts.
