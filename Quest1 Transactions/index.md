# Introduction

Today we get a first experience in the most core element of blockchains and cryptocurrencies: transactions. We will learn to interact with public APIs and wallets to move cryptocurrencies around. 

Most blockchains offer three categories of networks:
- The main network `mainnet` on which value is transacted
- One or several `testnet`, that work more or less similarly to the mainnet with no value
- Local networks, to test locally with a node

Today our quest will focus on testnets.

*Caution*
You should not use any crypto with value for any exercise of the module. If you already own crypto, we recommend that you create a new separate wallet, configured to testnets, to avoid any loss of funds.
