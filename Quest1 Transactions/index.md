## Introduction

Today we get a first experience in the most core element of blockchains and cryptocurrencies transactions. We will use actual client software to create a transaction and send it to a local network. 

We will learn to interact with public APIs and wallets to move cryptocurrencies around.

Most blockchains offer three categories of networks:

- The main network `mainnet` on which value is transacted
- One or several `testnet`, that work more or less similarly to the mainnet with no value
- Local networks, to test locally with a node. It is called `regtest` on Bitcoin. 

*ðŸš¨ Caution ðŸš¨*
You should not use any crypto with value for any exercise of the module. If you already own crypto, we recommend that you create a new separate wallet, configured to testnets, to avoid any loss of funds. We will never use `mainnet` wallets for any exercise.
