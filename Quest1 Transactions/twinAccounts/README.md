## Twin Accounts 

### Instructions

- Create two different addresses on **Ethereum Kovan testnet**

- Ensure that both have emitted the same number of transactions and contain the same value of Ether. The two values must be superior to 0.
 
- Create a js file and store the address of your both accounts in an array `accounts`

#### Example:

```js
const accounts = ['0x8475Ff3608A96925b9106266F084dDAfa82a563e', '0x11dC467C6433BE24bF20c9f41C3593a26A0A98D9']
```

### Relevance

This exercise helps to understand the representation of Ethereum accounts. In particular, the notion of nounce.
