## Introduction

It is time for us to advance beyond basic contracts for integrate with actual DeFi smart contrat. For this we will need to use current standards and implementations. 

First, we will create a simple stablecoin, following the ERC20 standart and an oracle. We will then create a decentralised exchange that will allow us to exchange our stablecoin. Finally, we will create the tests for this project.
