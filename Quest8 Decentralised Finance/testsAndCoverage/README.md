## Tests and Coverage


To produce adequate tests is the first obvious step to start applying good security measures. We will create the tests for the stablecoin smart contract. 

### Instructions
- For each function of the `stablecoin` smart contract, create two tests, one that handles the failure of the function and one that handles the success of the function. You can use any testing framework.
- Provide the documentation to run your tests. Once a testing framework is available, the user should be able to launch the tests with one command line.
